How to run the NLVR code?

1. Please making sure that your machine has the Pytorch and AllenNLP environment;
2. Coming to "run" folder;
3. Runing code by "python run.py"
4. If you want to know the mechanism of NER training, you can run "python run_ner.py"

Some important pathes:
1. data: Storing the nlvr dataset.
2. data_preprocessing: Coping with data preprocessing, including: Sentence to embedding, vocab index, etc.
3. model: The key component in the project, which is presenting the whole Deep SpRL architecture.
